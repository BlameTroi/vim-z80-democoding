Vim configuration for z80 coding.

This repository contains personal and public piece of code.
I do not really remember where I have found the syntax file.
It is adapted to match sjasmplus.

The aim of this repository is to provide z80 configuration in order to ease
my development for the Amstrad CPC.
So, syntax highligting, functions and so on can not be of interested in context
different than Amstrad CPC democoding, or even for other people than me.

Anyway, it is public and can be interesting for other people.
